                <p>My journey began with service in the active component of the Army as a Healthcare Specialist (<date>2015-2019</date>). After getting married, I tr ansitioned to the Michigan Army National Guard as a Human Resources Specialist (<date>2019-2023</date>). Currently, I'm in the inactive component, embracing the rewarding role of raising my daughter and enthusiastically dedicating my spare time to learning the exciting world of coding and development

                <p>While I'm still developing my confidence in many areas, my military experience has highlighted the importance of effective communication and teamwork, even in challenging environments. Observing how diverse teams had to collaborate to achieve objectives, despite individual differences, has given me a foundational understanding of the value of these skills, and I'm eager to further cultivate them in a more collaborative field like software development.</p>
      
                <p>I'm also aware that attention to detail is crucial in coding, and it's an area where I'm actively focused on improving. My time in the military, with its emphasis on procedures, has shown me the necessity of precision, and I'm committed to developing this skill as I learn to code to ensure accuracy and functionality in my work.</p>
      
                <p>Ultimately, my military experience has instilled in me a strong work ethic and a commitment to continuous improvement. Even in areas where I don't currently feel like a natural expert, I'm dedicated to learning, adapting, and growing, and I believe this mindset will be a valuable asset as I embark on a career in software development.

                <p>While I first considered transitioning into tech after my initial Army contract and even looked into IT certifications, I was unfortunately discouraged by some well-meaning individuals due to my lack of direct experience and limited knowledge. I allowed those doubts to take root, believing it might be unrealistic to pursue tech at that stage without prior exploration. Although I dabbled in coding, it never truly stuck.</p>
      
                <p>The arrival of my daughter brought a powerful shift in perspective. Witnessing her keen observation of everything around her, I felt a strong desire to become a better version of myself and set a positive example. I want to show her the importance of not limiting herself based on others' perceptions, labels, or self-doubt, while also building the skills to provide for her in a meaningful way. Overcoming my own limiting beliefs and pursuing this path in tech is a significant step towards becoming the role model I aspire to be for her.

                <P>My initial exposure to the tech world through the Google IT Support Professional course sparked a curiosity, but as I began exploring programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I discovered a deeper fascination with the creation aspect. While I appreciate the problem-solving involved in IT support, I found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of using code as a tool to build something new – to transform ideas into tangible solutions. The potential to create applications, websites, and tools that could solve problems or enhance experiences became incredibly appealing.</p>

                <p>Unlike the more reactive nature of tech support, software development offers a proactive and creative outlet. It's about envisioning possibilities and then bringing them to life through logical thinking and technical skill. The feeling of building something from the ground up, of crafting a solution that didn't exist before, is what truly excites me about development. Furthermore, the continuous evolution of technology within software development means there's always something new to learn and explore, which aligns with my desire for ongoing growth and intellectual stimulation.

                <p>One of the biggest challenges I've faced is the limited and often fragmented time available for learning, as I took on full-time care for my daughter when she was just a few months old. Compounding this, the majority of my learning journey has been navigated solely through my phone. While coding and problem-solving on a small screen can be undeniably frustrating, it hasn't deterred my determination to learn and progress.</p>

                <p>While still early in my coding journey, I believe the most challenging problems I've tackled so far are those from Harvard's CS50 course on edX. Although I'm currently about a third of the way through, the last problem set pushed me significantly, requiring several days of persistent effort, numerous questions asked, and considerable rewriting of code. With each problem, there's been a point where I've doubted my ability to solve it or fully grasp the underlying concepts. However, I've learned the value of perseverance; by consistently pushing forward, I've managed to find a solution each time.</p>

                <p>My approach to problem-solving typically involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts that I feel I can initially handle. I experiment frequently, research concepts I'm unsure of, and if I hit a roadblock, I'll often switch to another part of the problem and cycle back to the tricky areas later with fresh eyes. Frequent testing and running the code after each change is crucial for understanding the impact of my modifications and identifying errors early on.</p>

                <li>Started Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science on edX (discovered this opportunity through Verizon's free year).</li>
              
                <li>Solving small coding problems daily to reinforce and refresh information (became a more intentional practice as I saw the connections between concepts).</li></ul>

                <p>In one year, I hope to be significantly more proficient in my coding skills and actively working on more complex personal projects that address real-world problems. While securing a full-time developer role within a year might be ambitious, my primary goal is to have a strong portfolio that demonstrates my abilities and my passion for creating solutions.</p>
              
                <p>I'm particularly interested in exploring how technology can automate redundant tasks, drawing inspiration from my HR background where I saw firsthand the potential to reduce errors and improve efficiency. I'm also drawn to the idea of developing immersive educational programs and inclusive study tools that can help underserved groups overcome limitations like time constraints or disabilities.</p>

              <p>My background in Human Resources has given me a firsthand understanding of the inefficiencies that can arise from manual, repetitive tasks. Therefore, I'm particularly interested in exploring automation through software development, with the goal of building tools that can streamline workflows, reduce errors, and free up human capital for more strategic initiatives.</p>
              
              <p>Furthermore, my passion for learning and my desire to help others succeed has sparked an interest in educational technology. I'm excited by the potential of creating immersive and engaging learning experiences, as well as developing inclusive study programs and tools that can address the diverse needs of learners, including those facing limitations related to time or accessibility.</p>
              
              <p>While these are the areas that currently excite me the most, I'm also open to exploring other domains as I continue to learn and gain more experience within the field. My priority is to develop a strong foundation in core development principles and then specialize in an area where I can make a meaningful contribution.</p>
